# Garden

Garden is a library for rendering CSS in Clojure and ClojureScript.
Conceptually similar to [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup), it uses
vectors to represent rules and maps to represent declarations. It is designed
for stylesheet authors who are interested in what's possible when you trade a
preprocessor for a programming language.

## Getting Started

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/garden/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/garden)

Garden 1.2.5 and below requires Clojure 1.6.0 and is known to work with
ClojureScript 0.0-2342. However, starting with Garden 1.3.0 Garden requires
Clojure 1.7 and ClojureScript 1.7.x to leverage a unified syntax with
[reader conditionals](http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Reader+Conditionals),
and other major changes in the compiler and repl in Clojurescript.

## Syntax

Garden syntax is very similar to
[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup). If you're familiar with Hiccup
you should feel right at home. If not, don't sweat it! Garden's syntax is
simple.

From your project's root directory start up a new REPL and try the following:

```clojure
user=> (require '[garden.core :refer [css]])
nil
user=> (css [:body {:font-size "16px"}])
"body{font-size:16px}"
```

First you'll notice the use of the `css` function. This function takes an
optional map of compiler flags, any number of rules, and returns a string of
compiled CSS.

Vectors represent rules in CSS. The first _n_ **non-collection** elements of a
vector depict the rule's selector where _n_ > 0. When _n_ = 0 the rule is not
rendered. To produce a rule which selects the `<h1>` and `<h2>` HTML elements
for example, we simply begin a vector with `[:h1 :h2]`:

```clojure
user=> (css [:h1 :h2 {:font-weight "none"}])
"h1,h2{font-weight:none}"
```

To target **child selectors** nested vectors may be employed:

```clojure
user=> (css [:h1 [:a {:text-decoration "none"}]])
"h1 a{text-decoration:none}"
user=> (css [:h1 :h2 [:a {:text-decoration "none"}]])
"h1 a, h2 a{text-decoration:none}"
```

As in Less/Sass, Garden also supports selectors prefixed with the `&`
character allowing you to reference a **parent selector**:

```clojure
user=> (css [:a
             {:font-weight 'normal
              :text-decoration 'none}
             [:&:hover
              {:font-weight 'bold
               :text-decoration 'underline}]])
"a{text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal}a:hover{text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold}"
```

A slightly more complex example demonstrating nested vectors with multiple
selectors:

```clojure
user=> (css [:h1 :h2 {:font-weight "normal"}
             [:strong :b {:font-weight "bold"}]])
"h1,h2{font-weight:normal}h1 strong,h1 b,h2 strong,h2 b{font-weight:bold}"
```

`garden.selectors` namespace defines a CSSSelector record. It doubles as both a
function and a literal (when passed to the css-selector). When the function is
called it will return a new instance that possesses the same properties. All
arguments to the function must satisfy ICSSSelector.

`garden.selectors` namespace also defines these macros that create a selector
record: `defselector`, `defclass`, `defid`, `defpseudoclass` and
`defpseudoelement`.

`garden.selectors` namespace also defines many CSSSelector instances such as:

* Type selectors `a`, `abbr`, `address` and [more](src/garden/selectors.cljc)
* Pseudo-classes `active`, `checked`, `disabled` and
  [more](src/garden/selectors.cljc)
* Language and negation pseudo-classes `lang` and `not`
* Structural pseudo-classes `nth-child`, `nth-last-child`, `nth-of-type` and
  `nth-last-of-type`
* Pseudo-elements `after`, `before`, `first-letter` and `first-line`
* Attribute selectors `attr=`, `attr-contains`, `attr-starts-with`,
  `attr-starts-with*`, `attr-ends-with` and `attr-matches`
* Combinators `descendant`, `+`, `-` and `>`
* Special selector `&`

and allows to compose complex selectors such as this:

```clojure
(defselector *)
(defpseudoclass host [x] x)
(defpseudoelement content)
(> (host (attr :flipped)) content (* last-child))
;; => :host([flipped]) > ::content > *:last-child
```

`garden.selectors` namespace also defines a CSS3 selectors's `specificity`
function:

```clojure
(specificity "#s12:not(FOO)")
;; => 101
(specificity (a hover))
;; => 10
```

Clojure maps represent CSS declarations where map keys and values represent CSS
properties and values respectively. Garden's declaration syntax is a bit more
involved than rules and understanding it is important to make the most of the
library.

Declaration map keys _should_ either be a string, keyword, or symbol:

```clojure
user=> (css [:h1 {"font-weight" "normal"}])
"h1{font-weight:normal}"
user=> (css [:h1 {:font-weight "normal"}])
"h1{font-weight:normal}"
user=> (css [:h1 {'font-weight "normal"}])
"h1{font-weight:normal}"
```

Be aware, Garden makes no attempt to validate your declarations and
will not raise an error if other key types are used.

```clojure
user=> (css [:h1 {30000 "nom-nom"}])
"h1{30000:nom-nom}"
```

We've already seen strings used as declaration map values, but Garden also
supports keywords, symbols, numbers, maps, vectors, and lists in addition.

##### Strings, keywords, symbols, and numbers

Strings, keywords, symbols, and numbers are rendered as literal CSS values:

```clojure
user=> (css [:body {:font "16px sans-serif"}])
"body{font:16px sans-serif}"
```

Be warned, you must escape literal string values yourself:

```clojure
user=> (css [:pre {:font-family "\"Liberation Mono\", Consolas, monospace"}])
"pre{font-family:\"Liberation Mono\", Consolas, monospace}"
```

##### At-rules

Where CSS notation uses constructs such as @media, @keywords et al.,
you can use the `at-rules` functions from `garden.stylesheet`.
See `at-font-face`, `at-import`, `at-media` and `at-keyframes`.

## Thanks

A big thank you goes out to [@weavejester](https://github.com/weavejester) for
creating Hiccup, [@briancarper](https://github.com/briancarper) for creating
[gaka](https://github.com/briancarper/gaka/), and
[@paraseba](https://github.com/paraseba) for creating
[cssgen](https://github.com/paraseba/cssgen). I learned a lot
from studying the source code of these libraries (and borrowed several ideas
from them). Writing this library would have been significantly more difficult
without the hard work of these individuals.

I'd also like to thank [@jhardy](https://github.com/jhardy) for putting up with
random questions and pushing me to keep working on this library.

Thanks to everyone in `#clojure` on IRC for answering my questions and being
patient with me. If you're looking for an example of a great community, look no
further.
